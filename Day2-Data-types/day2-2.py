## BMI Calculator
# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# **Warning** you should convert the result to a whole number. 
# # Example Input
# ```
# weight = 80
# ```
# ```
# height = 1.75
# ```
# # Example Output
# 80 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) =  26.122448979591837
# ```
# 26

#Hint
# 1. Check the data type of the inputs.
# 2. Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
# 3. Remember PEMDAS.
# 4. Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int). 

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

# ans = int(weight) /  float(height) ** 2
#or 
ans = int(weight) / (float(height) * float(height))

print ("bmi is :",int(ans))
